# Minimalist-Fitbit-Watch-Face

A first attempt to create a watch face using the fitbit studio. First time using CSS and Javascript so its been an interesting evening of trying to put everything together!

Glad it works, although I had some trouble getting the heart rate monitor updating, so do look into the code to see how I managed to make it update every second.
