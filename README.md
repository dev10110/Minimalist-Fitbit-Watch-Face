# Minimalist Fitbit Watch Face

A first attempt to create a watch face using the fitbit studio. First time using CSS and Javascript so its been an interesting evening of trying to put everything together!

Glad it works, although I had some trouble getting the heart rate monitor updating, so do look into the code to see how I managed to make it update every second.

## Key features
 - a simple, large and clear digital time
 - the date, with month clearly stated below it
 - the heart rate and steps taken in that day listed above the time, in an easy to glance at manner. 

 ## Future updates
  - a system where the colors change based on the time of day or activity levels
  - ability to compare the day's activity to my historic distribution?
   - incorporte weather information?

   so many things I could do!
   but I really want to make sure its readable and clean!
